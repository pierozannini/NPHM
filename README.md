# NPHM
The script here presented describes a sampling strategy for assessing habitats at large scale. Particularly it has been produced as part of the research work involved in devoping the Italian National Plan for Habitat Monitoring (NPHM) in compliance with the art. 11 and 17 of Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC). The territory of interest could be any one covered by a collection of quadrat (called “quadrats”) of a given size (i.e. 10kmx10km art. 17). For any habitat H you should know the quadrats in which the habitat is present. Each quadrat will be then divided in cells (called “cell”) of an appropriate size (i.e. 100mx100m) suitable to be surveyed for detecting the presence of a habitat H . For each cell there should be available a score 0 ≤ xj ≤ 1 indexing the probability of presence of habitat, the score (i.e. habitat suitability score or HSS) could be determined by models or remote sensing information. The HSSs will guide the sampling of cells and those cells for which xj=0 having no possibility to host an habitat will be excluded from the population to be sampled. Therefore the set of cells for which the HSS takes positive values (i.e. those for which there is a possibility to find the habitat) represents the population to be sampled.
